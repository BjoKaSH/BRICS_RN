Summary
=======

This folder holds a copy of the enhanced stage simulator and related software
used in the Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMR) course at Bonn-Rhein-Sieg University
(BRSU).

It is here to serve as a lightweight replacement for the Gazebo simulator
usually used in ROS.  Stage has the advantage of being less demanding regarding
hardware OpenGL support and it is generally easier to setup and run.

Copied and used here with permission.  For comments regarding any of the AMR
packages in this folder, please contact Dr. Bj√∂rn Kahl <bjoern.kahl@h-brs.de>
